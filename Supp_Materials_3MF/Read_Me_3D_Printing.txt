This folder contains 3D printing files for the Burrow Scale Monitor parts shown in the Supplemental Materials figure. The names align with the labels in the figure with two exceptions:

- in the figure, the Load cell to PVC connector assembly points to the two interlocking pieces which are called 'ConnectorAssambly_Plug' and 'ConnectorAssambly_WireClamp'. 


There is also a file called 'SuperJig' which allows you to aligh the Weight Platform with the  Exit_Cap as the Weight Platform is securely connected to hte PVC Outer casing through the 'ConnectorAssembly_Plug'.
