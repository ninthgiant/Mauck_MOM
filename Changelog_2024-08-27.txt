We now just calculate weights from mean(=w1), median, and window with the best/min slope (=doSlope0)
    No need to calculate W2 in the program itself when we are also outputting the slope information?

Added process_auto() function
    See documentation for details
    Currently asks user for manual calibration
    Then automatically scans that single file
    This is quite fast even on large files, because the vast majority of the data is ignored (<30g)
    Even with w_windowed_min_slope doing the measurements, these measurements are only calculated WITHIN the areas of the trace >30g

Catch error invalid calibration values entered in gui window

Catch errors from incomplete DraggableMarker pairs
    This is done by confirming the new "good" return value every time we call get_trace_point_pair()
    After every call we return, break, or continue, depending on the context
    This makes some errors much smoother, e.g., now you only have to exit out of a window once if you select the wrong file

Moved all output to output_() functions in MOM_Processing
    NOTE rounding happens only in output_weights, not anywhere else!

Output includes a counter that marks the number of traces measured from the same file.
    This means we can easily match manual OR automated trace measurements to a spreadsheet of known weights with column names Filename | Trace_Segment_Num | True_Weight

Output includes the number of samples in the full trace segment (as used for mean), and the number of samples in the window with the lowest min slope

Output includes the slope across the full trace segment (as used for w1) and the slope in the minimum slope window (as used for doSlope0)
 This means we don't need to do any weight adjustments in the program itself. These can be calculate W2 in excel

Moved fit_slope to separate function in MOM_Calculations
    This is always used to calculate the np.polyfit slope across any section of data
    Will make it easier to change to stats.linregress later if that proves faster

Moved user calibration to separate function in MOM_Processing
    This means we can call it in Manual, or semi-automatic as desired

Moved run weights to separate function in MOM_Processing
    Returns a formatted CSV line as defined in output_weights()
    Optional adding a header line, as passed to output_weights()
    Optional printing to GUI screen, as passed to output_weights()
    This means we can use the same chunk of code to run in Manual, Automatic, etc.
    Also means we can store the return value (formatted CSV string) to write to a batch file
