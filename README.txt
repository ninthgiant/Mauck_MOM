# Mauck_MOM
New repository for GUI work. Development until now done in other repositories, but I corrupted those somehow. This is a do-over.
 
As of June 28, 2023, MOM_GUI_v01.py opens a window with 3 buttons to work with MOM datafiles. The user can input the weights of the known calibration weights. Information on any opened file is presented to the user in three columns. 

As of June 9, 2024, the latest version is MOM_GUI_v07_Main.py. It is reorganized and commented. It calls other .py files that contain some of the code from the original v_05.py codebase. The other files need to be in the same folder to make it work. The other files are:
  MOM_Calculations_v07.py
  MOM_Graphing_v07.py
  MOM_Utility_v05.py

From terminal, run MOM_GUI_v07.py
