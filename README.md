# Mauck_MOM
New repository for GUI work. Development until now done in other repositories, but I corrupted those somehow. This is a do-over.
 
As of June 28, 2023, MOM_GUI_v01.py opens a window with 3 buttons to work with MOM datafiles. The user can input the weights of the known calibration weights. Information on any opened file is presented to the user in three columns. 

In the same folder (directory) you need to have both the MOM_GUI_v01.py and the MOM_GUI_set_user_values.py files. You should change these default settings in MOM_GUI_set_user_values.py to match your local machine. However, you can also change them on-screen each time you use the app.
