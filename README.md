# Mauck_MOM
New repository for GUI work. Development until now done in other repositories, but I corrupted those somehow. This is a do-over.
 
As of June 28, 2023, MOM_GUI_v01.py opens a window with 3 buttons to work with MOM datafiles. The user can input the weights of the known calibration weights. Information on any opened file is presented to the user in three columns.
